          <h1>Life Growing Up</h1>
          <h4>Bio:</h4>
          <p id="bio">
            It all started November 19, 1999(#90's baby and #Scorpio Gang). I grew up
            in the small town of South Plainfield, New Jersey with my two parents and 
            annoying younger sister. Growing up I was very active and played a multitude 
            different sports with my favorite being football. Not to brag or anything
            but I feel I was fairly decent at almost all the sports I played. While I 
            had much success playing sports my parents made sure my academics matched 
            that. Though I would't say I stood out academicly like I did in sports, I 
            definitly held my own and finished in the top 10% of my class. Overall I think 
            I am a fairly wellrounded person and if you want to get to know me more scroll 
            down to see some fun stuff I've done.
